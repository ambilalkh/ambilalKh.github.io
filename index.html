<p>Hello! I am Muhammad Bilal Khan, a doctoral student at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Universiy of Delaware. My research lies in computational plasma physics, where I study how fundamental plasma processes govern the behavior of space and astrophysical environments. In particular, I investigate the ubiquitous interplay between magnetic reconnection and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, and how these processes drive energy conversion, plasma heating, and structure formation in systems such as the solar wind and terrestrial magnetosphere. I am also interested in scientific computing and machine learning, developing data-driven methods to analyze complex, high-dimensional datasets from both simulations and space plasma measurements.</p>
